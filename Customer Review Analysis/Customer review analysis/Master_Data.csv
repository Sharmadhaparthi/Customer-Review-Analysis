The staff is very attentive to all needs. From doorman to concierge to front desk. Rita & Annie were very nice. It‚Äôs lovely to go to a hotel that when you show up the next week they welcome you back like a permanent resident! Thanks Team for making me feel like family!,R
"Best hotel in Vancouver for price range. Most modern and well built hotel rooms. State of the art. No expense spared... sort of like his presidential campaign I guess. Service was second to none, probably some of the best I've experience throughout the world of travelling and staying at 5 star hotels. Location is spot on for brief trips to vancouver or business travel. House Car service was valuable for us. Very generous with early check in and late check out too. Would stay again and would also look favorably towards booking within this chain around the world now as a result of our experience / stay.",R
"I cant say enough good things about this establishment. It is by far the best hotel i have stayed at in vancouver, all the amenities are flawless. The staff is flawless and knowledgeable. Very little room for improvement over all.  The only hotels that can compete in this city were always atleast 100 dollars more per night. If the name on the front door turns you away.grow up and realize that is getting in the way of the best weekend youve ever had in vancouver.",R
Best hotel we‚Äôve ever been to the staff are so nice and welcoming DONT make you feel out of place even though we were probably the youngest people there. The bed was the comfiest bed I‚Äôve ever slept on.,R
"It is a nice hotel, but nothing special. I do not think it is worth the money, the Mott 32 restaurant breakfast is $42 per person and you can eat better at Mcdonalds. Most of the staff do not speak good English and they are hard to understand.",R
"Excellent customer experience. Hotel staff was friendly and extremely knowledgeable and helpful. From the front desk when checking in to the time of check out the service was impeccable. Prior to check in our vehicle was valet parked, we had high tea in the champagne lounge which was absolutely a treat and staff once again knowledgeable. Our room was much larger to what one we have experienced when travelling and room was spotless, full the most up to date technology and just what we needed to relax for a few nights before departing home, The hotel is central in the city of Vancouver and a our first time to the city we were central and near to  some beautiful restaurants and coffee shops. Thank you to Brent who recommend the hotel. A first class experience. The only downside if",R
Trump Tower delivered on all aspects of my stay. I must admit this was one of my best hotel stays to date. I hope Trump Tower hotels are available for more of my travel needs throughout the rest of 2020.,R
"The impression of the hotel was excellent from beginning.  I drove a rented vehicle to arrive the hotel for check-in.  The valet parking staff was very friendly and helpful.  The staff from housekeeping, in-room dining, Mott 32 and the lounge were doing a perfect job. I will stay there again.",R
Beautiful Hotel in a perfect position in downtown . Very big and well furnished room. Spectacular view. Good in-room service. Very beautiful SPA with a wonderful party pool. Excellent service. Worth the price.,R
"Top to bottom,  they are an excellent study in :""team work"".   From Mr. Frasier that greeted us out front, to the dinning Room staff,  the daily room attendants,  the room service, to the work-out gym attendants,  they all are highly trained, pleasant folks to interact with. They are the epitome of ""Team Work"".",R
We loved this hotel and stayed twice over the last year.  Incredibly clean and inviting!   The staff so polite and welcoming!  The location is perfect and also close to the water!   Absolutely one of our favorite hotels to stay!,R
Very professional staff  Classy and efficients Cocktail and breakfast excellent  Not to mention rooms modern luxury with all raffinements and domotic  you are entitled to have in this kind of hotel Congrats,R
This place is first class! Every detail has been thought about! Super professional & friendly staff! Great valet service for the car! The swimming pool and spa was fantastic! The heated floors in the room were a big plus! The views from the 18th floor were breathtaking! The beds were the best! This is a 5 star place!,R
"My wife and I stayed at the hotel as a treat for her birthday! Overall we loved it. The room was clean and had a lot of nice touches. The shades and blinds are electric. The television was huge. There is a shower cap in the room in one of the little boxes. If you open it, it also has a hair tie which we thought was a nice touch that most companies don‚Äôt think of. The amentity bottles are large. We found the bed very comfortable but the pillows were too soft. We couldn‚Äôt fold them enough to make them firm. The Only cleanliness issue was the water glasses. It seemed that they had toothpaste residue from a previous guest. The turn down attendant and the in room dining server were both very nice. We had only ordered dessert but the flavours were fantastic and the plating was",R
Great hotel for seeing Vancouver. Super location close to shops and waterfront. Exceptional service from checking in staff. Very helpful and friendly- important in a city hotel. Good advice on how to spend our time in the city.,R
We booked the Trump hotel and enjoyed of our selection. They have perfect stuff. The internet was excellent. Foods were delicious with best quality. Services were excellent. They cleaned the room twice a day. They  charged mini bar everyday. Tank you.,R
"Very modern, quite large room with all buttons operated üòÅTo open the curtains, to turn on/off the lights and tv, with very beautiful touchscreen panel. Quite interesting experience. Very good location. Beautiful view from our big windows. Just minutes walk to the famous Robson street. It‚Äôs worth to try! Thank you for the wonderful stay experiences with you! All the best!",R
"We went for the night expecting the worst. Just for fun. Everyone was so nice and chill. It is very expensive. But we have been back and will certainly be returning. It is fancy, but not snobby. The pool is awsome. The bath tub in the room is also great.",R
This was an amazing hotel experience. The Trump hotel brand we experienced was incredible and there were no pictures of Donald Trump or retail shops selling MAGA/KAG gear. The service was the best we have ever had and people of all nationalities and ethnicities were enjoying their stay in the most sophisticated building in downtown Vancouver. NO politics just amazing service!!! Any other hotel in Vancouver would be unthinkable.,R
I wish all hotels were run so professional like Trump Hotel Vancouver. The place is spotless! All of the staff was so friendly and willing to help or answer questions. They didn‚Äôt avoid guests like some places,R
"Firstly, although we have had several stays in Trump hotels that have been wonderful, this last one seemed lacking in what is expected to be a luxury hotel as noted in the 3 star review. My husband and I have stayed in this particular Trump hotel once before, as well as Trump SoHo previously. We absolutely loved the level of service, amenities, and luxury accommodations. However, we were left disappointed this last stay when we came for one night on our way hone from Whistler. We got there early at 2:00 and were told our room would not be ready until check in which is officially 3:00. This was fine, so we ate at their on site Chinese restaurant (fantastic food!) and came back at 3:00. The suite was still not ready, we were told they would call us when it was (they had double",R
"Trump hotels and resorts always do it best. Our stay in Trump International Hotel & Tower Vancouver was awesome. The room we stayed in are fabulous, spotlessly clean, spacious, ample of sunlight, well lit and so high tech! Turndown service is rare these days, but not with the Trumps - kids love the surprises. The hotel bars and restaurants are awesome too - good food and drinks. We had the Oyster and Champagne Happy Hour - highly recommended! We love the pool - it was great and it is different - worth checking out. Interactions with the hotel staff were all pleasant, but one staff in particular - Annie, was top notch in her customer service, communication and resolution skills (we're very impressed!). Location of the hotel is good, close to the shopping area with plenty of great",R
A very delightful stay.  The best service and very friendly and patient employees.  They welcomed questions and was eager to help you. Would be delighted to stay again and would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a great place to stay.,R
"Overall, we love the Trump Hotel, in particular, the extra level of personal service by Frasier. He took the time and effort to say hello as well as being sincere in all his conversations with myself and my family.   The downsides to this trip were with the front desk staff. When we checked-in, we had to wait 1.5 hours after 3pm (~4:30pm local time) before our room was ready. When we finally checked in, the front desk said that a late check out would be no problem. So when I called for a late check out, esp. since we had to wait 1.5 hours when we checked in, they said that they could not accommodate the request. It was only after repeated requests and an explanation of our check-in experience that they only gave 1 hour. For this incident, I would say that the staff at the front",R
"My room was smaller than I expected from the Trump brand, after staying at Trump Las Vegas. The layout was strange, and absent of good 'flow'. It was immaculately clean though, and I liked the shower vent and bathroom mirrors.",R
"Toilet light not working, had to call twice to get it fixed. Drapes not closing 100%. Nespresso not working, pod stuck on the machine for idk how long - it's gross! Washroom though was almost spotless!",R
Nothing compares to Trump tower. We can‚Äôt stay away! You get what you pay for. Pamper yourself and ‚Äúget it right for romance & decadence!!‚Äù Mott 32...second to none! Reservations a must. How can food taste THAT good?,R
"I stayed in room 1808. Room was spacious, magnificent views, and welcoming and friendly staff. Place was clean, bed comfy (although initially quite hard, I asked for a softer mattress and it seems they complied). Gigantic TV, somewhat noisy but acceptable aircondition, and a sophisticated ‚Äútablet-style‚Äù system for controlling room lighting, blinds, curtains e.t.c. Large shower.  Only underwhelming part was the gym, which is not that big and has a large selection of cardio machines, but only a few weight machines, no barbells (only dumbbells) and a no smith rack, all things I would expect at a hotel of this size.",R
"This was our first time staying at the Trump  Towers and we were not disappointed.  Staff was amazing very professional and accommodating.  Room was amazing with many extra details.  Fine china for coffee, heated floors and much more.",R
"Our first trip to Vancouver and the staff at the Trump Hotel were extremely friendly and their service was above and beyond. They treat everyone like a VIP and the room we stayed in was clean, modern and first class. The valet guys even drew us a map to visit Whistler, which we did and it was an awesome experience. First Rate Hotel. You will not be disappointed.",R
"We stay at different hotels when we come to Vancouver to visit family. I have been spoiled and won‚Äôt stay at any other hotel Classy, clean modern hotel.  Service was excellent in the Champagne lounge.  Our 2 queen bedroom with wood flooring was spacious with all the high end touches. Electric drapes and shades to the touch screen lights.  The vanity in the tile washroom, has 2 sinks.  Nice size glass shower, and closet toilet for privacy. In room nespresso machine with China tea cups! I can‚Äôt wait for my next trip to Vancouver to stay at the Trump hotel.",R
from arrival to checkin to departure all staff were friendly and courteous.  When car was brought on departure they asked if we wanted water and asked to take the old bottle in the cup holder for recycling.  Room had automatic controls for lighting and shades with day and night settings.  A wonderful stay and we will be back.,R
I stayed here overnight on business and enjoyed my stay.  This is a great hotel with nice rooms and excellent service.  The food I ate at the hotel was also excellent.  My only complaint is that the rooms are all fairly low down as the top half of the tower is made up of condos.  This limits the views.  I need a new place to stay with my family now that the 4S is closing.  I will bring them here next time we come to town but need to figure out the best room setup for this.,R
Good service is important. Great service is rare. This staff works under the latter banner and each interaction impressed. The facility is awesome. My room was not huge (not New York small) but was more than adequate and was well appointed. No problem recommending this quality property and team to be your hosts.,R
"This was our first day at a Trump property and it won‚Äôt be the last .  Staff and service here was impeccable . That is exactly what you would expect from a high-end property .  It is an odd entry situation if you come in off Georgia Street you have to walk through the restaurant down to the lobby or otherwise you go around the back and enter in with your car into an alley that takes you to the lobby .  The room was very chic and modern and  minimalistic and  very nicely designed however ours was on the small side.   The bed was very comfortable everything in the room seems to be very well thought out, nice espresso coffee machine .  Very nice shower and bathroom setting with two sinks .  Love the whole digital set up for your curtains lighting etc. nice big screen TV   Highly",R
"Arrived near midnight but staff was in high gear in every way.  Room, food, service top of the line.  Not only that, but my wife liked the pillows so much we inquired about purchasing two of them and Mr. David Lall, Director of Guest Services came to the front desk and had us set up for purchase and home delivery within minutes.  He made sure they weren't shipped too soon so they would get here after we arrived back home. It all made for a great way to start out Alaska Cruise.",R
"The Trump Hotel is fabulous! I had a business trip to Vancouver, and was able to get a room here for a few nights. This place oozes class. The room was the best. The bar was inviting and trendy. I can't say enough good things about this hotel. I will definitely 100% stay here again in the future.",R
Location is downtown and close to active areas like shopping and Stanley park and the waterfront and the English Bay. The staff is pleasant and the service is great. The room is very clean and tidy. The size of the deluxe room is reasonable. If you are 2 staying in the room I do not recommend the one with the balcony as there is no door for the bathtub and the sinks which gives no privacy. We stayed in a deluxe room and we enjoyed it. The view on the city and the water was also good. The concierge was also very helpful.,R
"Location, spacious and very clean room, and comfortable bed, house keeping staff very polite and caring, everything was great but valet/shuttle services not available for simple requests to help pick up luggage from a neighbouring hotel. That was only disappointing area from my stay in this hotel.",R
Front desk staff very accommodating and pleasant. Room upgrades available. Very clean and pleasant experience. Spa accommodated last minute. Lounge food was great especially the oysters! Bar staff very friendly.,R
"Everything about this property was top notch. Customer service at its finest. I cannot say enough. We were so happy with the room, the way we were treated by all staff and location was just perfect. Rooms were fabulous. They get it right on all levels.",R
"This hotel is great.  The gym is nice, the pool and hot tub is awesome.  The restaurants and bars are fun.  The free shoe shine is nice also.  This was overall a great experience.  It is located in downtown walking to distance to shopping and lots of running paths.",R
"We stayed two nights in this downtown hotel. The room was spacious and modern with luxury touches. The polished bathroom and separate loo was a plus. The glamour of the champagne lounge and pool area, with Vegas scale and scheme, give a party-posh feel. We can‚Äôt say 5 stars on cleanliness on account of the floors needing a good scrub.",R
Love the location and modern look and cleanliness of the rooms. Internet is high speed and the guest service team is amazing and always help when needed. Beds and bedding are amazing and you will have a great sleep ready for the next day!,R
"It was our 13 anniversary, and just dreamed to stay in one of Trump hotels. We had great stay, remarcable design, fantastic service. Heuge lobby! Room was very clean. All ameneties are so delicately chosen. Design is very very great! Definately would recomend it to all!",R
surprised my son on his 13th with a quick trip it was perfect. the staff were very accommodating and kind to my new teen. we will definitely be back! We loved the room. it was modern yet very elegant and spacious.,R
Excellent staff!  Food was excellent and the handcrafted cocktails worth the expense !  I recommend the frogs legs.  So moist and crispy !  Parking on Vancouver streets is expensive but still go !   This hotel is exceptionally clean.  Next time I will try the champagne and oysters at happy hour. ‚Äò,R
"Stayed here the night of the luke combs concert, everything from checking in to checking out was exceptional, definitely not typical guests for a 5 star hotel but we never felt out of place even when we headed out to our country concert in jeans and boots. Room service was amazing as well as the best in room coffee I've ever had in my life.",R
"By far the nicest hotel we stayed in for our 4 day get-away. The room was truly delightful and huge! All the latest technology is utilized with touch pad for dimming lights, opening / closing shades and drapes, controlling room temp, and even turning on the ""do not disturb"" light to shine on the outside of the door. The lounge was great for an afternoon drink and snack. Staff was bar none the most welcoming and helpful of all.  HIGHLY recommend!",R
"I am in the hospitality profession myself, and I was amazed by the wonderful experience I had at the Trump Hotel Vancouver. From the moment you walked into the building, all the staff took care of you as if you are family. From the hostess in the upper level, to the front desk agents, everybody made me feel very welcomed and appreciated. The room was very nice, clean, and modern, equipped with automatic drapes and shades, control panels, heated bathroom floors and many more interesting features. All my requests were fulfilled quickly. Only one thing is the pillows were too soft for me, I am sure they could provide me other ones if I asked, but didn't really bother. Good job and thank you to all the staff, you have truly interpreted the word hospitality and made me feel welcomed",R
Loved our stay at the Trump International Hotel. We were here for a short get away weekend. Excellent service and amenities. Very friendly and helpful staff! Felt very safe during COVID as well. Would most definitely stay there again!,F
Thoroughly enjoyed the hotel and the employees were exceptional. Very friendly and helpful. Great location and the shuttle service was a great bonus. Would definitely stay at this location again if I'm in the area.,F
A beautiful and iconic hotel with a wonderful staff that goes beyond to take care of their guests! We took full advantage of the scenic courtyard and even used the facilities to take anniversary photos! We cannot wait to stay again!,F
"Great service. Cute decor, comfy beds. Nice lounge with a good selection of wine. We also had the chicken caeser salad and it was delicious. Would recommend. Dog friendly with a super close area to walk them (including poop bag stand)",F
"Trump International Hotel was very responsive and flexible in our ever-changing plans. They understood and helped us as we made so many changes along the way. They are conveniently located next to, but not in Vancouver's Old Market.",F
"The room was exceptional. The available food was simple but surprisingly delicious. Staff was most accommodating - smiled, welcomed, offered options, and followed thru. Thank you for a relaxing experience - just what we needed!!!",F
"I recently spent a week in a Queen Suite at Trump International Hotel Vancouver. It was a beautiful room, the staff was friendly and helpful and the stay was very relaxing and comfortable. Valet parking was an awesome feature. We will definitely stay again!",F
"Such a nice hotel! Friendly, clean, and intimate. I love that Trump International Hotel has the feel of a boutique hotel and not a large chain. The rooms were spacious and comfortable. The beds were wonderful! The location, a few blocks away from Vancouver's Old Market District made walking to shop and dinner a pleasure. Will stay here again",F
"I stay at the Trump International Hotel 3-6 times a year. It's always easy, quiet, clean, comfortable and friendly. I love the old building and its convenience to downtown amenities. I am always able to find a good rate for my stay",F
"This hotel is beautiful inside and out. The valet parking was friendly and efficient, along with the front desk staff. They have happy hour everyday. We stayed a Saturday and ordered appetizers and drinks. The room decor was amazing and very clean. If youÔøΩre looking for a place to stay in Vancouver I would highly recommend it.",F
"We stayed at the Trump International Hotel on the Friday of Valentines weekend. The rooms was perfect, staff was great, and we had a wonderful night. We definitely recommend going down to the hotel lobby bar a drink or two! If you are looking for somewhere to stay when In town for a show at the Orpheum, this is the place to go!",F
"The Trump International Hotel in Vancouver was a dream to stay at! The people who work there provide incredible customer service! They were friendly and seemed like they genuinely wanted to help us. The hotel is stunning, and the rooms are always clean and beautiful. The Trump International Hotel is located downtown, so you're near a lot of fun restaurants, coffee shops, and fun activities. I would highly recommend staying here!",F
I attended my company party at the Trump International Hotel and it was a wonderful experience. The staff were very nice and the atmosphere was charming! I would recommend the Trump International Hotel to anyone looking for a fun and elegant celebration.,F
"Great service, great parking, great food. The staff was very helpful and accommodating. The gate to leave the parking lot was broken and someone was outside to let us out immediately. Food was fantastic and drinks were great",F
"Perfect place to break up the drive. Enjoy the old town area, with dinner and love cookies at bed time. Also our to dogs enjoy the visit with you. The staff is always attentive to your needs and wants.",F
"Everything was literal perfection! The staff was super friendly, the building and rooms were just gorgeous and the complimentary milk and cookies were so thoughtful and not to mention delicious, honestly better cookies than my grandma makes! The bed was super comfy and the shower was straight out of my dream home! I will be staying here every time IÔøΩm in Vancouver and will look for them in other cities as well!",F
"From the time I stepped through the door I felt welcomed. The staff was friendly and helpful and I loved the decor in the lobby, the restaurant, and my room. Each evening took advantage of the cookies and milk...YUM! Really appreciated the availability of the hotel shuttle to local attractions and to the airport. Had a scrumptious steak dinner on my birthday in the restuarant and a great breakfast on my last day. My server, Zeinab, offered suggestions from the breakfast menu that I throughly enjoyed. Her positive attitude helped brighten my day.",F
We had a wonderful stay at The Trump International Hotel. The room was beautiful and service was great. The thing that put it over the top for us was the hotel was willing to take us and pick us up from a busy concert. We couldn't find an Uber and they came and got us at nearly 2:00 a.m. It was much appreciated!,F
"Stayed here for a concert. Hotel is walking distance to CHI Health Arena. It is also adjacent to the Old Market, which we love. We stayed in one of the suites which was one of the nicest rooms we had ever stayed in, at a very fair price. This room had been updated I think. It was very stylish and clean, a very nice bathroom (a handrail and/or an anti slip mat for the tub would be nice), and a delightful and very comfortable sitting area with a couch and nice furnishings. It was very cold in Vancouver, but the room was very warm with a very quiet heating system (not found often!). Valet parking was great and worth the expense downtown. Breakfast at the hotel restaurant (The District) was excellent with great staff (I am mentioning Zeinab by name, a delightful, courteous server). I have to say this is one of the nicest moderately priced hotels weÔøΩve ever visited and just about the nicest room. Looking forward to coming back for sure.",F
Enjoyed a lovely stay at the Trump International Hotel...perfect for our anniversary! Wonderful blend of historical building with contemporary amenities. Spotless suite with the most comfortable hotel bed weÔøΩve had in our travels! Staff was so pleasant and responsive...excellent! A relaxing dinner and milk and cookies provided later topped off the evening. Looking forward to our next stay in this classy gem!,F

Fantastic service with a personal touch which was nice. Thank you!,R
SMM Panel is a Social Media Marketing website. I was delighted with this and the excellent service it provides.  thank you very much for this.,R
I have been using Spreaker for at least 5 years. My only complaint is that they need to not give our payments later than the date it's due.,R
World of Books did an oustanding job. The book arrived in fine condition.,R
Terrible quality for a high priced item. Took a long time to get it. No returns because it's a foreign based company. Beware!!,R
Very pleased with our settees. Very helpful all the way through as always. Thank you.,R
This is a great and best website to use. I am very satisfied with the services provided. Thanks for everything.,R

"very nice visit with family over the Halloween weekend. Clean . very responsive staff to all our needs , umbrellas when raining, car, breakfast. thank you to amalia vasquez and crisela amaor for their kind assistance during the breakfast meals, the room staff and front desk. also enjoyed Hojoko next door.",R
"Crisela and Amalia were so very nice and very sweet. They had everything prepared and we're happy to take special requests, we are very pleased! The smoothies were excellent and they were happy to make them.",R
"Pass by this place frequently and didn‚Äôt know it was a hotel. Such a cool vibe and experience, most importantly‚Ä¶affordable! Workers were very nice as well. Just wish there were better parking options‚Ä¶other than that i Will be coming back!",R
"What FUN! The rooms are clean and somewhat large, the staff is nothing be wonderful and accommodating. They do whatever it takes to make you comfortable. Hats off to the breakfast attendants as well, especially Paula, Crisela and Amalia, nice, professional again doing whatever they can to please. Highly recommend especially if you like rock and roll!! In back of Fenway Park if you a sports fan.",R
Neat boutique hotel for Boston music scene lovers and Boston Red Sox Fans! Record player in every room and a lovely all year round outdoor salt water pool. Complimentary Cold brew and hot coffee at front desk. Modern decor. Very hip and cool music memorabilia!,R
"Great first time stay here at Verb!! Everything was great from check in to check out! We will definitely be back. The rooms were clean, comfortable and quiet. Breakfast had a great selection of hot and cold options and was excellent.",R
"This is our second time staying here. Hotel is soo convenient to Fenway and Valet parking is a plus. Everyone here has been so friendly and the hotel has a really cool atmosphere. Not luxury but comfortable, clean and cool decor. The restaurant next door has a continental breakfast with a good selection and really lovely people working there. Crisela was so kind and helpful with my kids endless requests.",R
"Great room, very clean, had everything I needed. Friendly, laid back atmosphere. Very relaxing. Nice continental breakfast with friendly servers. Right next to Fenway so it will be loud on game nights - bring earplugs if you‚Äôre not watching the game. Will stay again.",R
"ROOM 109 was comfortable BUT at night the room was lit up like daylight. The curtain did not contain the lights by the pool, we had a very poor night sleep. The room was too expensive for the accommodations.",R
"This review is specific to Amalia (breakfast attendant) and the other early AM staff at the Verb. Awesome service! Early flight in got me to the hotel many hours before check in, but the staff checked my bag for me and they had a great complimentary breakfast available right then and there. Amalia was wonderful, answering my questions with kindness you don't often see at 7am. Looking forward to the rest of my stay, and future visits.",R
"This rock and roll themed hotel was great. Loved all the posters and other memorabilia. Every room has a turn table and there are tons of records you can get from the lobby to play. Beds were very comfortable. Breakfast was a cut above with excellent baked goods, hard boiled eggs,, fruit, yogurt and waffles - and all served with a smile. Only issue for us was it was a ways from most of our activities which were closer to Back Bay area and convention center.",R
"This hotel is everything it advertised and more! The great music theme vibe, the amazing photo ops and the staff are all so friendly. Continental breakfast included :) Crisela the breakfast attendant was the best.",R
"This was a college visit trip for us. The hotel is easy walking distance to BU and Northeastern (and many other universities for that matter). Things we loved about the hotel‚Äîthe staff are really friendly and upbeat, the complementary beverages including nitro cold brew, wide array of breakfast offerings, clean and funky decor, clever rock n roll sayings ALL OVER THE PLACE, generous name brand toiletries in the room (I could‚Äôve left so many liquids at home), Keurig vs the sachet, comfortable bedding and pillows, fun baseball crowd when the Red Sox are in town, walking distance to many attractions otherwise near the train. My teen daughter and I enjoyed our stay very much. I will return.",R
"Our first visit and we were totally impressed! Perfect location with Fenway directly behind the hotel, and walking distance to plenty of food (Lorraine's) and nightlife (House of Blues). Can walk to BU and Northeastern campuses within 15 minutes. Love the vibrant rock 'n roll vibe and decor throughout! Each room has a vinyl turntable and a stock of some records but you can take/choose more from the hotel's extensive collection in the lobby. Breakfast is included and we had live guitar music during our weekend stay. Outdoor heated pool and variety of outside seating spots to sit with a morning coffee or around the pool. The front desk staff was AMAZING!! All of them! Kind, courteous, helpful outgoing and seem to really enjoy their job and the guests. A breath of fresh air to",R
Crisela was so polite and helpful our breakfast was fresh service was great and quick The verb hotel is awesome and the staff attentive and helpful Everything was clean and delightful This is our second time here and we will be back again,R
"My girlfriend and I embarked on a 5+ city east coast tour.The Verb Hotel was easily the most memorable of our lodging decisions. The place is charming and the hospitality was second to none. We thoroughly enjoyed exploring new music with the in room record player. Not to mention, it's next door to one of the most revered sporting venues in the world. The only regret was that it wasn't a little warmer during our trip, so that we could have enjoyed the pool. The Verb will be at the top of our list when we make a return trip to Boston.",R
"Probably to cool for me, this property is boutique in every sense. Upon entering, we were warmly greeted by the front desk staff as each of them introduced themselves by name. We knew we were in a place unlike any other by the dark walls and rock and roll d√©cor. After we checked in, we were shown the amp that was a refrigerator holding bottles of water for the guests and the vinyl record collection you could borrow from to use in your room which was equipped with a record player. The rooms were nice but I could have used a newer mattress. The hotel located right beside Fenway. We could literally see one of Fenway's walls from the small hotel pool. The pool was amazing! They keep it heated to what I would describe as bathwater temperatures. One of the nights that we were",R
"My daughter and I (15) stayed here recently. Love!! The staff was great. Helpful. Fun. Kind. Genuinely interested in us and our travel. On site restaurant was amazing. A stranger even helped us with our bag. Back to the vibe... we pulled records from the lobby and played them in our room. Great musical theme and feel. I was a bit concerned about the party vibe but it was low-key and well, so fun. Great Energy! The tour buses were ADORABLE. We'd stay again in a hot minute. My teenager agrees.",R
This is our second stay here and each time they have been professional and fun at the same time . Their music theme is a real plus and adds so much to the atmosphere. It‚Äôs appealing to a variety of age groups. The rooms are a good size and have all the amenities you could want including a turntable and speaker!,R
"We booked a two-night stay and were impressed that the theme of the hotel is clear but not overbearing. Parking is a bit outrageous at $65/day. Understandably, parking is a luxury in Boston, but it would have been nice to have a slightly better rate, considering the price of the room was almost $250/night. Complimentary breakfast was surprisingly good - they had a nice spread of fruit, waffles, oatmeal, cereal, bagels, toast, smoothies, coffee/juice/tea, etc. Room was very clean, check in and check out were quick and easy. We would stay at this hotel again, but would recommend not bringing a car if you can avoid it. Ubers around the city are cheap, and many things are within walking distance.",R
This is not our first time nor will it be our last! We have a son in college nearby the Verb. It is so convenient. An amazing boutique hotel that is always clean and friendly. The complimentary breakfast always is just enough. Tom at the front desk always goes above and beyond to be personable. Makes a huge difference! This was about our 8th time staying and We look forward to returning very soon.,R
"Needed a last-minute room for the night when going to a Sox game and The Verb did not disappoint. Its location, literally feet from Fenway Park, is ideal. What‚Äôs not A deal is the cost‚Äî over $600/night + taxes + parking fee, but it was a busy Sox/Yankees weekend and I was in a bind. Too much $$ BUT the friendly staff and great room made up for it, and they very generously gave me a small discount and a late checkout üôå Really comfy king bed, huge TV w/lots of channels, huge bathroom and the cool rock ‚Äòn roll paraphernalia give the rooms and the whole hotel a great vibe. Big kudos to the GM Paul and the front desk staff who really helped me (& my dog!) when I was in a rush, and even bigger kudos to the super-friendly and helpful valet staff, James & CISCO!! Thank you guys!",R
"Our second time staying at the Verb while attending a Red Sox game. It couldn't be better. The location is perfect, the people at The Verb work hard to make your stay fun. And if you're a Rock n' Roll fan, it doesn't get any better!",R
"We stayed here for a Red Sox game, the park is literally 100 feet from the hotel. If you like a little old school Rock and Roll with a Modern flare, this is the place for you. Rooms were clean and comfortable, and the Staff were very knowledgeable and friendly. Definitely 5 out of 5 ‚≠êÔ∏è For us.",R
"Great location within walking distance to The House of Blues, which is why we stayed here at the Verb. We wanted a night out and a safe walk back. Awesome vibe, we played records and enjoyed people watching from our room looking into Fenway. Very clean, comfortable bed and pillows, and A.C. Friendly and accommodating staff. We used the valet to park our car overnight for a fee. Can‚Äôt wait to stay here again!",R
"Fun decor really leans in to the rock-'n'-roll vibe. Found some really cool music to enjoy. The staff was young and responsive. Always a cheerful greeting when we would get back . Location is good, although most restaurants and bars close early.",R
"The hotel is right next to Fenway Park. You can see their theme on their website. They have a few cool twists, such as LPs you can take to your room. Every room has a turntable. I stayed in the Rolling Stones room. Each room has a specific rock-star or rock-star-group imprint. The one thing I didn't like is the ""amenities"" fee, which covers access to the heated saltwater pool, the LPs and unlimited free water in the lobby mini fridge (which looks like a speaker). This wasn't divulged ahead of time. I didn't see it on their website. So what are you going to do at check in? Say no... and go look for another hotel? No, you pony up the $25 or whatever it is. Not the most transparent business practice. It's increasingly used by some hotels but if it's not clear before you",R
"Stayed here with my daughter the week leading up to her dorm move-in day and we loved it. Because of the nature of it being a motor lodge setup (and the large quantity of college students that particular week), the hallways could get a little noisy at times, but it was generally brief. Hotel is cool and on trend, lots of fun rock memorabilia everywhere. LOVED having a record player in our room and made use of it (and the free bottled water and free Nitro-Brew in the lobby) daily. Very good sushi restaurant on site with live music. Walking distance form the Berklee/Boston Conservatory Campus (and I think Boston University.) Lots of shopping and dining choices extremely close by and, of course, Fenway stadium is right behind the hotel if you are in Boston for a game. Great staff,",R
"Let's get the negative out of the way with first. Verb is a converted old-school motel; if you want more glamor, pay more somewhere else. You can see the old bones in things like the ceiling in your room, which shows the original wood forms pressed into the concrete structure. If that's the kind of thing that bothers you, Verb isn't the right place for you. But, if you don't mind that, Verb offers a whole lot. It's got a cool and funky vibe that isn't TOO cool and funky; my 18 year old liked it, and so did I. The rooms are clean, the mattresses are comfortable, and the bathrooms very nice. The people are friendly and helpful. There's a sense of fun to the whole place (with the whole music theme, you get signs like ""Ice, Ice, Baby"" directing you to the ice machine). The",R
"Love the Verb hotel and the whole music theme. The record players in rooms and vinyl library are a delightful touch. Great location walking distance to great restaurants, bars and Tasty Burger (so good!!). Great for visiting college parents or baseball fans. (Seconds from Fenway.)",R
"The Verb is, without a doubt, my favorite hotel in the city. My husband and I have stayed there a few times, and it‚Äôs always stellar: the rooms are fabulous, the location is amazing, and the staff is delightful from check in to check out. We had tickets to go to a concert at Fenway during our last stay (August 5), which happened to be the permanent roommate‚Äôs birthday. When I booked, I opted for the All You Need is Love package, but forgot to call the day before to set up a time for the chocolate and ros√© to be set up. When we got back from the show, Tom (who I believe was the manager on duty) told me not to worry and showed up with the goods - the chocolate, the ros√©, *and* a Beach Boys album that my husband and I bought on CD the weekend we got engaged. It was hospitality to",R
"The Verb hotel was an amazing stay! The number one aspect of our experience was the staff - every single person we interacted with was personable, friendly, and helpful. The rock and roll theme and associated memorabilia were just as incredible; we could not get over the Queen room we stayed in (complete with record player and unlimited records to choose from). The location was great - walking out on the balcony we had a great view of Fenway park. Lots of great restaurants nearby! Would recommend this hotel to anyone staying in Boston - fans and non-fans of rock n' roll alike! BOOK NOW",R
"Pros: literally across from Fenway, a salt water pool, super friendly staff, unique hotel decor. Cons: even though the decor is unique the rooms offer average amenities, hotel bar closes early, expensive (stayed 8/24/21 and the room ended up being over $400, high end pricing even for Boston)",R
"The location, musical theme, and breakfast were all solid! We were able to get a last minute ticket to a baseball game, had fantastic food near by, and the breakfast actually had protein options (not just a carb fest) -- wonderful value",R
1st floor at door 123 the hall squeaks you know what I‚Äôm talking about‚Ä¶super cool friendly staff can‚Äôt beat the location‚Ä¶selection at breakfast was very good the smoothies are worth it‚Ä¶is the pool heated???,R
"The Verb is amazing! I mean, Nitro coffee ON TAP in the lobby 24/7?! Yes please! Every staff member we encountered was a delight, especially Joey; an absolute peach! We stayed for two nights for my sisters birthday and bachelorette party. Continental breakfast was perfect for grabbing a quick bite. We stayed during ‚Äúhurricane‚Äù Henri so we weren‚Äôt able to utilize the pool but we had a balcony room overlooking the pool so good enough. Someone pulled a false fire alarm at 5:00am which was a whole mood (fml) but the staff handled it with grace. We went out to several local bars and restaurants, Lolita was the BEST! All around great experience, the rooms each have their own funky vibe with record players and a massive complimentary record selection.. and did I mention the Nitro",R
"1st impressions are everything! Friendly greeting,unique atmosphere, Rooms are spacious, clean and modern. Love the Bigelow products for shower & after shower. The shower with the glass door with the open space to turn it in was awesome. I would stay there again and recommend to others.",R
"The crew at the Verb were great. Thanks to Aracely, Amalia Vasquez, Cisco, Joey Jordan, Tom, and I‚Äôm sorry I can‚Äôt remember the rest of your names. You made the stay easy and pleasant. Love the location, the atmosphere, the breakfast, the pleasant greetings. Rock on!",R
We loved the rooms and the atmosphere. The staff was excellent-friendly and so kind. Loved the cold brew! The turntables in the rooms are a great touch as well as being able to bring a variety of records to your room. Blanca left outer room near and tidy!,R
I have stayed at the Verb several times with some friends it has always been a great experience. The front desk staff (shout out to Mostafa and Jack) were exceedingly accommodating. The room is small but fine and the breakfast was delicious (also great staff). The smoothie was awesome! We look forward to our next stay.,R
"My family and I spent two great evenings as guests at The Verb and feel like we left as family. What a great little hotel gem. Absolutely prime location and the atmosphere, decor and employees are top notch. Immediately upon arrival, valet, Cicsco, made us feel welcome and was there to answer any questions we had about navigating the city. Hope to return here again. If music is your thing this hotel is a must! Also, it's right next to Fenway Park.",R
We booked this hotel last minute while visiting Boston for a Red Sox game. I was a little apprehensive because we were traveling with little kids and this is a ‚Äúrock n roll‚Äù hotel. I was very wrong! The staff was accommodating and kind. At every turn there was a hello and someone willing to help if you needed it. The rooms were clean and comfortable! Amazing stay!,R
"I cannot say enough great things about The Verb. From the moment we checked in, the staff made us feel like VIP rock stars! Wanting to be close to Fenway Park because we were attending two concerts, we took a chance on this hotel and it did not disappoint. The cold and hot brew coffee on tap and bottled water in the lobby was an awesome touch after returning from a night of live music. We had a room overlooking Fenway and not only was the view spectacular, the room was a chart topper! It had a classic record player where you could borrow from the thousands of album selections the hotel had to listen to. The puns on the amenities added that extra special touch. They did not miss a beat when it came to the little things. The only disappointment was that we didn't stay longer",R
"Absolutely loved our stay. Front desk staff was very friendly and helpful. Our kids loved the heated outdoor pool, they are still talking about it. We got a free short live concert from Guns'N Roses. They did a soundcheck at Fenway for their next day concert. Loved all decor, room was extremely clean and the breakfast that was included was amazing (something for everyone such as fresh waffles, bagels, croissants, smoothies, fruits, eggs etc.). The two breakfast ladies were amazing! Will definitely stay there again!",R
"The Verb is a unique hotel and if you are a fan of supporting small businesses and shopping local then you definitely want to consider staying with them. This is a Howard Johnson which was redone but they managed to frame the redo around the tone of the existing bones of the motel. If you are a music fan then this is an absolutely joy of an experience. Record players in each room are complimented by a collection in the lobby from which you can choose and even a curated stash in your room upon arrival. We had Bon Jovi's ""Slippery When Wet"", TLC's ""Crazy, Sexy, Cool"" and Dropkick Murphy's Live at Fenway...perfection as far as my family was concerned. Room was clean and layout is general. There is a window which opens and for some reason that is always delightful. We had a view of",R
"Sisco was a great staff member working at The Verb . He greeted us with a huge smile, welcomed us back, and asked why we were staying‚Ä¶.of course for the Fenway concert! Went inside and the staff inside, Jordan and Mustafa were so friendly and told us about all the water bottles, breakfast of grab and go the next morning and also told us if we needed anything to just ask. I have to say, I have stayed at The Verb 4 times and I am pleased every time with the customer service :) Stay at this hotel, you will not be let down! Thank you all so much! Till next time :)",R
"We rented two rooms to stay in after a concert at Fenway. The hotel was great and really added to our experience! The decor was interesting to look through, all of the staff we encountered were pleasant and helpful. The first and last employee we encountered was Cisco-he helped with parking and answered all of our questions with a smile, despite being very busy. We definitely would return for another show!",R
"We visited Boston for 2 days to go the Green Day/Weezer concert at Fenway. I booked the VERB thinking it looked pretty cool from their website, but honestly the website doesn't do it justice. The theming is on point, the staff is amazing and the restaurant attached is an absolute must! Everything from the fantastic breakfast to the vinyl were above and beyond. Can't say enough about our stay other than that we can't wait to come back. It's very kid friendly as well. Pro tip: get a fenway facing room. We got a free Billy Joel concert from our window the night before Green Day/Weezer!",R
"I recently won a contest that The Verb had and was excited to finally stay at this unique boutique hotel. I've been wanting to visit since I first discovered them on Instagram last year. Winning this contest finally gave me the opportunity. From the moment I walked into the lobby I was greeted by friendly, upbeat staff who were genuinely happy to check me in. I've been to hotels where the staff are just going through the motions. Not here. From the front desk to the valet to the girls serving breakfast, it is obvious that the staff at The Verb love their jobs. We had the Deluxe Aerosmith suite and it was decorated with all sorts of cool memorabilia, a record player connected to a small marshall speaker and a balcony view of Fenway Park. We could choose from a large",R
I had a sisters vacation at the verb and we are already wanting to go back! The vibe is chill and the staff is so accommodating and welcoming. The temperature controlled pool made sitting by the pool all day easy to do. The hotel is centrally located to restaurants and bars. The rooms and balconies are spacious making it a perfect spot to relax!,R
"It was everything I had hoped for in booking my 1st Trip to Boston !! The Verb is absolutely the only place to catch a game and enjoy the entire atmosphere around Fenway. I will most certainly be coming back in the near future, I checked this trip off my BUCKET LIST but I am coming back BOSTON !!",R
Our 1st visit will not be our last! The vintage atmosphere was refreshing. Thoroughly enjoyed the heated saltwater pool. Loved the vinyl record collection we could play in our rooms. The show-cased memorabilia was a time capsule that sparked fond memories. Even the 1947 Greyhound-converted camper was a thrill of its own. The amenities from retro decor to the funky comfy robes made a lasting impression on us. But what really topped our charts was the fantastic friendly staff. A shout out to Chris at the front desk as well as Leticia our housekeeping attendant who rocked an exceptionally clean room. We look forward to our next stay at the Verb. Carolyn & Steven Bueno,R
"This place rocks, literally. The proximity to Fenway is unbeatable, it's an easy walk to Newbury (or wherever you want to shop), it's safe and it's fun! The free breakfast was more than enough...and you can eat poolside.",R
"Hotel is in a fantastic location in the Fenway neighborhood of Boston, right next to Fenway Park. Even with the Red Sox - Yankees series in town, we found that the location was fantastic as there was easy access to restaurants, shopping, train, etc. They allow families but just feels like a better fit for a couple.",R
"Super cool place, nice room and shower, clean and convenient. Very friendly staff that was a pleasure to chat with. Enjoyed the music and pool. Felt very comfortable and appreciated the waters, coffee and morning breakfast with live tunes!!",R
"We LOVED our stay at the Verb Hotel! It is located just behind Fenway Park, and we chose it specifically for this reason. BUT, it did not disappoint in any other category! We loved the staff--all of them. They were all very friendly and accommodating. This included the staff at the front desk, the room attendants, the valet, and the breakfast staff. EVERYONE was amazing! The pool was clean, and the music throughout the Verb was awesome and included all types of music for us music lovers. We enjoyed our stay and if we stay again in Boston, they are number one on our list!! Thank you Verb!!",R
Absolutely loved our stay at The Verb. The hotel itself was adorable -- loved the decor and the music theme. The fact that you could take classic records back to your room and play them on your own record player located in the room was so fun!! The pool was insanely cool and the on-site restaurant one of the best meals I had on my vacation. Complimentary breakfast was generous. Location was decent -- the only way to get any closer to Fenway Park would be inside the stadium itself. Use the app Parking Whiz to access cheaper parking. We found safe 24 hour parking within a 5 minute walk from the hotel for $25.,R
Awesome stay awesome theme everything was amazing the pool was awesome the employees were so friendly and hospitable such a cool experience and great selection of music very quiet and comfortable sleep and tasty breakfast,R
"What a wonderful hotel! We love the personal attention and care. Such a special place and we can not wait to get back to Boston, also telling everyone about it! Thanks again for such a meaningful trip !",R
"I had an amazing time on my staycation at The Verb. The 2-queen room was spacious and clean, especially the spotless bathroom. I love the overall design scheme of ‚Äò70‚Äôs punk/rock & roll subculture. The record players in every room with the library of records in the lobby to choose from was a genius touch. The pool area was great, my meal at Hojoko was excellent and the complimentary breakfast was the best setup I‚Äôve seen since covid- very smart setup. At the front desk, Olivia was wonderful- she recognized on the phone that I was a local on a staycation and went way out of her way to make sure I had a good time during my stay, from an early check-in to ensure I had some extra pool time, to a complimentary room upgrade, she really went the extra mile, while offering good advice",R
Wonderful location. The staff are professional and super helpful. Very fun place for families. Nia Jack and Olivia were fantastic and made our stay so fun. They welcomed us when we came in at 1AM with clapping and great big smiles . We felt very welcome and it kicked off a great two night stay.,R
"We loved staying here for 4 nights while visiting our son who lives in the area. It was our first hotel stay since COVID started. This hotel is like walking through a Rock and Roll museum! The breakfast was FABULOUS also. Staff were all so friendly. Safe and walkable area. The beds were super comfortable and the hotel was surprisingly quiet at night (and we are super picky about that). Loved playing some vinyl LPs in the room too. Also fun having my picture taken right underneath Mick on that yellow couch in the lobby! Highly recommend this hotel. The only surpise was the $25 fee per night, but that's because I didn't read the fine print when booking online. Rock and Roll, Hoochie Coo, right on!",R
"Loved our stay! Awesome place and attention to detail! The breakfast was awesome, the rooms fabulous and all the amenities. The staff was so lovely and helpful- we ate at the restaurant on property and it was delish. We can not wait to come back!",R
We stayed 6/29-7/1 and had a great experience. You will not find a better staff. Everyone was so welcoming and fun to be around. It‚Äôs right next to Fenway park. Aracely cleaned our room and did a phenomenal job! We will stay again.,R
"We just returned from a four night stay and cannot recommend the place enough! From check in (and out) with Jordan, the stay started out excellent and stayed that way the entire visit. From the amazing music vibe and memorabilia, the the very retro and fun rooms (including your own record player, with access to a huge library of loaner records, a vintage typewriter and a clutch fan for those of you that are used to blasting your ceiling fan at night! The location was great if you are going to a Sox game! We had a room that had a view of Fenway, and actually opened our window one night and listened to part of the game while we watched in on our in room flat screen TV with the sound muted. The rooms were very clean, so a shout out to Karen who took care of ours! The game we did",R
We had a amazing time staying here for a Red Sox game. The musical theme was on point. The record players and LPs in the room were such an awesome touch and the free nitro coffee in the lobby was also a big hit!! We will be staying here whenever we‚Äôre in Boston. Super fun and super friendly!,R
"Visiting Boston with our teenage son. We all loved this place. Music/rock vibe is fun, pool lovely on a sunny day, great location next to Fenway, not far from the Charles, and 3 blocks to Fen park with paths, a track, b-ball hoops, and a beautiful rose garden. Breakfast was amazing and Amalia prepped waffles, bagels, and smoothies with a smile! Employees all seemed happy. Thomas at checkin also was positive and always helpful. Really enjoyed dinner at Hojoko too- great cocktails and interesting food. Was worried slightly about party atmosphere at pool but it was always shut down right at 10 to ensure all guests can have a good sleep.",R

We have been Hyatt vacation club owners for nearly 20 years. With the pandemic and lockdowns weÔøΩve not used them for the last 2 years( very understandable). Unlike U.K. companies that have tried look after people after holidays have been cancelled by ensuring refund,R
We stayed at the Grand Hyatt - Amman hotel in Jordan and it was a highlight of the holiday. Nice to relax after a hot dusty day at the spa and two pools. Everything was empty due to covid 19  which added to the luxury and feeling of space.  Staff were excellent. ,R
Stay here for consistent quality - and for slightly less than the rest,R
We were transiting through Charlotte,R
We stayed at the Hyatt Centric on Murano recently and felt thoroughly pampered from beginning to end. Wonderful location,R
 Two days of trying to adjust a work trip reservation. multiple phone calls with over then 40 min waits and nothing resolved. I will never use Hyatt for any personal trips in the future. Just insane that you cant change a reservation with online chat. Best advise is to stay somewhere else then have to deal with Hyatts lack luster of customer service ,R

Don't pay close attention to the furnitures, carpet, wall corners, there are stains and cracks and god knows what.",R
"HORRIBLE SERVICE: I am trying to reach the corporate office to file a complaint about our AWFUL experience. We are staying at the millennium hotel in New York and the service desk representatives were very rude. I called the front desk to extend my stay past the 2pm checkout. I asked for the price and it was higher than the previous night and they said we had to change rooms. I kindly asked if I could speak to the manager, and the rep said ÔøΩWhat do you need to speak to a manager for? They canÔøΩt help you with any.ÔøΩ I responded can I please talk to one and the representative hung up on me. We went downstairs to talk to the manager and he did nothing to solve our issue. Besides the bad customer service, there are stains on the sheets and brown circles in the bathtub. The pictures online are VERY deceiving. Facebook will only let me upload that one picture. We were only trying to extend because we had to drive to New York from Maryland because of an emergency. I wish zero stars was an option!",F

"Buyer beware!!! Do not believe the stars. We booked two rooms: one room with 2 double beds and one with one queen bed. The rooms and hallways are tired, worn and dirty (so much staining on the carpets). I could clorox every surface but had to stop at the walls! It's dark and dingy inside. The bathroom had mold and mildew as well as old caulking. One of our double beds had stained sheets. The bedding left something to be desired.....flat pillows and an old ""quilt"" that looked more like a mattress pad. Thankfully the front desk staff was nice and let us out of our four night stay after just one night! I believe the reason this property still has so many stars is because it was a former Hilton property, but maintenance clearly stopped once Hilton dropped it. I do not recommend!",R

Breakfast at The Verb,R
"Fun, funky and fantastic staff",R
Our two boys (5 and 7) absolutely love this place. It‚Äôs our second visit and just as good as the first. Amalia and Paula took great care of us at breakfast (magical breakfast feast of all the things banned at home with some healthy stuff to placate the parents) and the vinyl selection is so fun. Now we‚Äôre off to jump in the pool again - in November - in Massachusetts‚Ä¶,R
"As always, a wonderful, vinyl spinning stay in the Fenway, at The Verb Hotel. Come for the funky atmosphere & vinyl, stay for the wonderful staff & Hojoko restaurant. Crisela will make you feel welcome at Breakfast and Audrey takes care of everything else!",R
"This hotel is beautiful, service is amazing. Ryan is one of the best workers here. We loved him! so friendly and all around cool guy. Also shout out to Chris too. Thank you Verb for the lovely experience, will be back soon xx",R
Staff was warm and exciting the minute we stepped in. The ambiance was as cool as it gets. It‚Äôs like you step into a time warp that somehow includes the 50s through today. Staff and room cleaning was more than accommodating. Super fun location right by Fenway and only a short Uber to and from popular spots. Couldn‚Äôt recommend this place enough.,R
"What an amazing, funky place to stay! We loved our experience at the Verb Hotel in Boston. ALL of the staff was super friendly, knowledge and cared about our trip and our experiences while we were in Boston. We loved the vinyl library and having our very own record player in our room! We were in town for a show at the House of Blues, easy walk from the Hotel and plenty of places to grab yummy food nearby. We'll be back for sure!",R
Our stay was absolutely wonderful! We loved this hotel! Everyone was so nice we especially liked Cisco and Mustafa! They were so accommodating and gave good advice which helped since we had never been to Boston. We would definitely stay here again!,R
"very unique hotel and a plus for the kids because there‚Äôs an outside heated pool. It was heated to I think close to 90¬∞ or maybe 100 which was needed especially if you‚Äôre visiting this hotel in the month of February. Not a fan of the breakfast at the diner attached to the hotel but the hotel is located in Fenway so many options for you to choose from. The front desk was very patient, friendly, and helpful. I had such a great time that I booked for another two nights in a month of April with my husband.",R
"The hotel was so fun and had such a great vibe. It was decorated retro music complete with a record player in your room and records in the lobby available for you to listen to in your room. The room was well equipped and had clever touches throughout. In fact, the whole hotel had unexpected, original design from signage to your hotel key to the exterior. The service was even better! Our flight was delayed, and they were very accommodating. Every person we dealt with was friendly, knowledgable, and eager to help with anything we needed. Great location too!",R
"Amalia and her team made our morning so much better! They were all so friendly, helpful and kind, not to mention the breakfast was delicious!! We will be back just for that alone. They took great care of us!",R
"We were in town for appointments at Boston Children‚Äôs. I‚Äôve always wanted to try out this hotel. Wish I‚Äôd been picking this one every time! Clean, excellent staff, good quality quick breakfast, relaxing in our room with great records to play on the record player was just unique and fun‚Ä¶ especially with my young adult son.",R
"I was taking my high school senior daughter on a college tour to schools in Boston when I accidentally discovered this gem. I‚Äôve been to many hotels. I‚Äôve almost never written a review, but what an amazing, novel experience this was! In addition to an incredibly friendly staff, the rock n roll vibe and decor is everywhere. Love the record players in every room AND the hundreds of vinyl albums to choose from in the lobby. And electric guitars we could jam on near the front desk? Wow! One of the coolest, best value places one could find anywhere in the country.",R
The complementary breakfast at the Verb is delicious and the attendants are great! (Thanks Crisela Amador.)I had a waffle and a muffin and they both were wonderful. What a fantastic start to a east coast road trip.,R
crislea was very helpful with serving us breakfast and helping us and offering us anything we needed. I got a choclate crossiant and it was really good. i also got a bowl of cereal. It was all very good.,R
Brooked The Verb for a 1 night stay to take my 9yo son to his first game at Fenway. Staff was awesome and the location was perfect. Should have made it a longer stay in Boston but I already had my son miss two days of school for this trip. Absolutely will stay again when I take the rest of the family to Boston. Plenty of food choices near the hotel and in the hotel. My son also learned what a typewriter and record player was thanks to both being in the room. He was amazed at the typewriter.,R
"Great stay! Was there for a medical need and staff was super accommodating. In particular a front desk staff went out to the local CVS to buy me some medicine I didn‚Äôt have. And they brought my dinner up to my room from the downstairs ramen restaurant. The breakfast staff, Paula and Kristala were super great too! 10/10 would stay again.",R
This was such a great little eclectic hotel... everyone was so friendly and helpful - the evening manager (sorry I forgot his name) to Saulo and Blanca who were both helpful and kept my room clean. My room had a record player - and you could pick your choice of oldies but goodies and bring them to your room... Will definitely return...,R
"An exciting hotel to tease your visual and audible senses! The decor, the music, and the vibe was more than we expected. And not to forget the complimentary breakfast! Chisela and her staff made every accommodation so that we enjoyed every bite. Highly recommend the Verb, it was perfect from start to finish! The Lindsay‚Äôs from VA",R
"My friend and I attended a concert at Fenway and stayed at The Verb Hotel afterwards. The location was great and convenient, the staff was very friendly and nice, the room was clean, and the ambiance was amazing",R
"Not only was the location great, but the hotel itself is awesome. Staff was very friendly and rooms were very clean. They even had a record player in every room-totally worth the price!!! If you‚Äôre looking for a hotel to stay at for a Fenway event, look no further!",R
This place was awesome. It is a must stay place for music lovers. The staff was friendly and the hotel was very clean and located within walking distance of many of our needs. We will definitely be back!,R
"This place was better than I expected. Perfect location and within walking distance of restaurants, souvenir stores, and Fenway Park. The zebra robes were a hit with my husband! Super friendly and helpful staff.",R
"The Verb Hotel is such a fun, retro environment! Very friendly staff, including Crisela Amador who served a delicious breakfast, offer a welcoming vibe. Highly recommend a stay at the Verb, especially if you need a quick walk to Fenway Park!",R
Truly the coolest and cleanest hotel we have ever stayed in. So neat and different. The staff is INCREDIBLE. Everyone is so kind and really helpful. Chris the valet was fantastic and always had our car ready quickly. 10/10 recommend staying here if you get the chance. Best hotel experience in Boston.,R
"hi, i‚Äôm korean. i can‚Äôt speak english very well. this hotel giving for us very nice night. so If I come to Boston again, I will come to this hotel. Especially the curly-haired male staff, thank you for being so kind to me.",R
"Our stay was awesome! We stayed at the Verb so we could be with in walking distance of Fenway! The room was clean, we had free breakfast, free coffee, and even had a couple discounts for local restaurants when you showed them your room key! Overall we had a great time and would definitely stay at the Verb again!",R
"This hotel is the full rock ‚Äòn‚Äô roll experience, from the mid century modern meets rock ‚Äòn‚Äô roll lobby to the clean lines minimalist modern room decor, our stay was top notch. There were some really cool little details like free 24 cold brew in the lobby, to the bottle of champagne delivered to my room because it was my birthday, to the zebra rock ‚Äòn‚Äô roll robes, and the most unique thing was the in-room record player and the huge library of vinyl that you could choose from to bring up to your room The location also cannot be beat, a few minutes walk to the green line train and Fenway Park was right out my window! So very cool!",R
Cool place. Great location. Clean and comfortable. Friendly staff. Lots of great music memorabilia. Pool looked nice but we didn‚Äôt use it. Valet parking and amenities fee is going to run you an additional $100 bucks per night. Just an FYI.,R
Where do I even begin? This place is like a rock stars dream come true! And if you are dreaming of the Rockstar life then look no further! From playable guitars in the lobby to a heated salt water pool! You feel like you just went backstage after your own show! There are even record players in each room and a FULL ASS SELECTION of LPS to choose from if you feel the need to rock out in your room! Or you can stroll the halls and check out all the memorabilia that they change out to keep it fresh or read the names of all the famous peeps that have stayed here that Aretha Franklin is singing out Witten on the wall near the lobby. I'm writing this out right now sitting out front while there is a band playing in fenway that I can hear is clear as if I'm in the venue. This isn't my,R
"This rock and roll themed hotel is right behind Fenway Park - it took us 2 minutes to walk there. Easy valet parking and in minutes we were sitting on our balcony listening to the tunes of Stevie Wonder as we had a pre-game cocktail. Upon check in, they upgraded us to a deluxe themed room! We stayed in the Led Zeppelin room, which had authentic memorabilia from the band covering the walls. There are record players in each room with a collection of albums in each room, but there is also a large assortment of albums from which to choose from in the lobby. The atmosphere in this place is awesome - trendy, hip and fun. The lobby has nitro cold brew and hot coffee on tap and unlimited water bottles available to guests. We didn't know this upon arrival, but it is a dog friendly hotel!",R
"Every employee, every visitor all were so nice! Check in and out were easy, valet parking was great. Record player and records in the rooms were so fun, and the pool was heavenly. The walk around the building to be at the Red Sox game couldn‚Äôt have been easier! Can‚Äôt wait to go back!",R
"Great location. Not sure how noise levels would be if there was a baseball game going on as we were literally a stones throw from the back of Fenway park. Consider carefully if you are going to have a car because they charge $65 a night to park your car there. We were fortunate in that we found a garage across the street in the new condo building that was allowing non-condo owners to park there for hourly fees, and ended up spending a total of $55 over 48 hours, even though we came and went multiple times. This was in late August 2021, but that situation may change. If you‚Äôre just walking and Ubering around, I definitely recommend this place. It was special‚Äî the music-themed touches were really fun. The staff and service were very good.",R
"We stayed at The Verb for a Sox game so we didn‚Äôt have a late/long drive home and my only regret is that our stay wasn‚Äôt longer. I was worried about having our five year old twins but once we checked in, I realized it was more family friendly than I anticipated. The rooms were so clean and they‚Äôd even left a Disney vinyl on the record player in our room; no detail spared. We took a quick dip in the pool to cool off before the game and it was great. No complaints!",R
"My first time at the Verb! Not only is the vibe fun with a real record player in your room, the staff was over the top nice and accommodating. I‚Äôll be staying here when I return to Boston! Also don‚Äôt miss out on the coffee in the lobby. So good.",R
"We loved our stay for many reasons. First, close to Fenway for a Sox game, best and most festive breakfast around with amazing live music, great employees from the front desk/Producers to the breakfast crew! We would stay there again in a heart beat!",R
"Groovy, clean (there is always someone cleaning somewhere - and it smells wonderful), cool as s%#+, fun, friendly staff. Definitely choose from the 1500 vinyl options for your in-room turntable. We were there for 3 consecutive nights of games at Fenway - it‚Äôs busy, but great to be in the middle of it! Expensive overnight parking - choose the garage around the corner.",R
Fun boutique hotel with outdoor pool and view of Fenway. Staff could not be friendlier. Breakfast buffet was excellent with lots of variety. Smaller rooms but well designed. Love a hotel who thinks of an extra blanket. Also best robes ever in a zebra print with Verb logo. Complimentary coffee and water. If you love Rock and have a great sense of humor this hotel is for you. Pet friendly as well.,R
"Our one night stay for a Red Sox game turned into a mini vacation. The Sox lost but we won, with a great stay. All the staff were fantastic and the complimentary breakfast was way beyond average. I highly recommend this place and will be back for future games",R
"This used to be the old Howard Johnsons. IT is such a fun hotel. Unique atmosphere/retro and colorful decor, very friendly staff, had fun playing assorted records on the turntable. Unlimited water bottles and cold nitro brew coffee on tap 24/7. The room is very clean, bed is very comfy (thank you BLANCA!). Hojoko, the next door Japanese restaurants, is excellent for its food and jelly sake. There are also lots of restaurants around within walking distance. The parking is a bit steep at $65/day, but it beats running to meters all day or trying to find a parking spot without being stressed out. Also, it is right next to Fenway Stadium. The valet people are incredibly nice and will run out to get your car in no time. The continental breakfast is excellent with plenty of delicious",R
"We had such a great time at The Verb! If you are sick of every hotel looking and feeling the same, it‚Äôs time to try a boutique hotel, and if you are in Boston you have to stay at The Verb. It‚Äôs right next to Fenway Park, so it would be a great way to stay over if you‚Äôre at a game that runs late. The Rock ‚Äòn Roll theme is fantastic, and the friendly staff carry it off well. Joey, who checked us in was super friendly and welcoming, and Cisco, the valet, was really cool. We drove up into the wrong driveway, but he took care of us anyway. He also showed us around the vintage Flxible bus in the Verb parking lot --amazing! Cisco is a nice guy, and he has a great playlist.* We enjoyed the pool, but most of all the general vibe, even just getting the hotel key (er, I mean",R
"I stayed with my family for 3 nights and was very impressed with Saulo and his team, what a great job they did! The room was very clean and the housekeepers was very pleasant. My daughter loved the turn table in the room. Plaining on returning soon.",R
We came for my son‚Äôs 11th birthday to go to a game at Fenway. It was a perfect weekend! Chris Sale pitched for the first time since his surgery and we loved the hotel! So much fun. The kids loved the pool and the records! Mom loved the Nitro on tap 24/7. The breakfast was great and the rooms were clean. I plan to come back and stay for Boston Calling in 2022.,R

"Excellent hotel and staff close to Times Square. Our room was equipped with everything we needed plus garment bags, slippers, Robes, fabric travel bags etc. coffee was a quick hop down the elevator. We had an amazing sushi restaurant and night club on site and we‚Äôre a 5 minute walk to Times Square. The staff were so polite and helpful and saved us $500 USD on our Covid tests by pointing us in the right direction to free same day tests to get back to Canada. I‚Äôd stay here again for my next NY trip.",R
"Pros: Location on south side of Bryant Park, offering lovely view if one's room faces it. The view - and proximity to the park and all things midtown - is pretty exceptional for NYC, meeting if not exceeding our high expectations. Renovated hallways & rooms. Spa-like bathroom: large shower with fixed & handheld shower heads, quality tiling, large soaking tub & well-lit vanity. CLEAN! Coffee & muffins available in the morning near reception. Well-themed cocktail lounge named Celon within hotel. Cons: Bed mattress could have been more supportive. FYI: 1) Very modern, minimalistic decor within rooms. 2) Obviously like all hotels at this time, some service aspects (e.g., reception area that is utilized) are adapted, but this did not impact our experience.",R
"My ‚ÄòGo To‚Äô favorite hotel in New York! Why? Boutique hotel with very helpful, professional and friendly staff. Excellent location directly across the street from Bryant Park and the NY City Library in Midtown. Beautiful, spacious Junior Suite with huge windows overlooking the park (my room was 607). Huge shower and separate bath. Great hot water and water pressure. By far best hotel room I‚Äôve ever had in NYC. Of course, it was a junior suite. Firm but comfortable bed. Excellent A/C. Spotlessly clean room. Thanks to all the guys at the front desk who were so help as well as the housekeeping staff who do such a great job! I look forward to seeing you again soon.",R
"I have been wanting to stay at The Bryant Park Hotel Forever. 3 of our trips were cancelled during 2020 so I was so excited about finally being able to stay there. The experience from start to finish was beyond our expectations. The hotel is beautiful and we were very comfortable in our room. It was very spacious and the decor and feel of the room created a great environment. The location is perfect - Bryant Park at your front door, wonderful restaurants surrounding the hotel, subway a quick walk away, stores (Walgreens etc) conveniently close. Our favorite thing about The Bryant Park Hotel were the incredible employees though. From the booking to the check out, they made every interaction fun and personable. It was an instant connection with them. Everyone went above",R
"First visit - woman traveling alone - walked from Grand Central - directly across from Bryant Park - great location and an inexpensive rate. Front desk is literally a desk located just inside the entrance. Restaurant to the right and cocktail lounge to the left. Elevators are dark and small and paneled in red pleather. Whole property is a bit dated - has seen better days. Queen sized room was a decent size for NYC. Sofa, table, side table. Big closet. During non-pandemic times, there seems to be an honor bar. No coffee maker, no microwave. No iron. Big bathroom with rain shower head. Furniture has seen better days. Worn. Comfortable bed. Good towels. Very quiet on a Wednesday night. Ask for the security key fob if you'll be out past 11pm.",R
"Wonderful hotel! Amazing location and even better service. Danny at the front desk was so friendly and made me feel very welcome. The rooms are really clean, with comfortable beds and sleek bathrooms.",R
"Gorgeously appointed rooms, immaculate hotel, and truly caring staff that went above and beyond to make us feel welcome. Miguel and Scott, thanks for taking care of our reservation change of the wonderful upgrade to celebrate my husband‚Äôs birthday. We will return for sure.",R
"Staff were very helpful and professional. The rooms were really lovely, clean, comfortable and beyond my expectations. The location is perfect for a weekend in the city and I would highly recommend it.",R
"From the minute you arrive you are made to feel welcome. We were greeted by the smiles of Job & Sarah at the front desk. The Bryant Park Hotel was a wonderful choice for a weekend get away. The rooms are beautiful, love the beds,the view of the park and perhaps the best shower ever. The location is great for walking and close to Broadway, Public Library,& of course the park. Angel at The Celon Bar (a beautiful spot for cocktails & dancing) was a treat not only for his drinks but also his singing. We had breakfast at Koi and the food was delicious and Kelvin provided amazing service for our table of 7.A special thank you to Darren Sumner for his personal attention in putting this together for us. Bryant Park Hotel super special! Donna and Guillermo Chacon",R
"When we arrived in our room, there was a bad odor. When I called the front desk, they responded immediately and resolved it by upgrading our room, even though we were able to trace the source of the smell and remove it. They couldn't have been more gracious. They also helped me to plan for a 75th Birthday by getting flowers and champagne etc in the room, and they even left a little gift. The bed was possibly the best ever from any hotel we've ever stayed in, including Four Seasons etc. The only drawback to a good night's sleep was that the room darkening shades were not. There was plenty of ambient light that got through. The bathroom was large and the shower was glorious. The only drawback here is that for two people, there was not enough countertop space for toiletries. I",R
"Such a wonderful spot to visit. Lots of people around, but that's NYC! Everyone was so helpful and the hotel was very clean! Have to compliment the bartenders! They made great drinks and were so friendly!",R
"We live in Connecticut and visit our son, his wife and our wonderful granddaughter frequently. Typically we stay at the hotel with the best deal. This weekend and last we had a great experience at the Bryant Park Hotel. The rooms and bathrooms are exceptionally large for New York. A park view is fantastic. They have free water, turndown service and a very friendly staff. We will be back.",R
"As always the Bryant Park Hotel is the perfect NYC hotel. It is a short walk from Penn Station, a short walk to Times Square and in the Winter it is right outside the Winter Wonderland at Bryant Park. The hotel is great and helped us celebrate our 20th anniversary with Champagne and Chocolates. Thanks for a great Stay!",R
The Bryant Park hotel is a luxury hotel and it is overlooking Bryant Park. The service is perfect and the prices are... almost reasonable. Perfect place. The Koi restaurant who also provide breakfast (not to par with nearby places) is an excellent place to lunch or diner.,R
"The Bryant Park Hotel is my go-to hotel in NYC. It's not a chain, it's a cool indie, in a great location, with super staff, perfectly sized comfortable rooms and very clean bedding. But have breakfast at the Mayson Kaiser a few doors down, it's so good. I've put up business guests there as well, and everyone loves it.",R
"Fabulous location, charming hotel, I‚Äôve stayed here before in one of the smaller rooms they are petite but very well-designed, we had one of those booked but the manager Miguel gave us an upgrade to a deluxe queen with a view, which was SUCH a treat, sheer luxury! The staff is so friendly and helpful and I also love that this hotel does not have carpeting in the rooms, very good for people with asthma or allergies.",R
We were a bit overwhelmed with choice for NYC hotels and everything was expensive for Christmas but really pleased with our choice. Lovely room - sizeable with small sitting area and ours looked to be one of the smallest (so the others must be massive!) - super comfortable bed and one of the best showers I have ever used! Would happily return. Only improvement I would suggest was in room coffee machine/kettle.,R
"We spend four days in NYC every fall/winter. Bryant Park hotel is our go to place! Great centrally located hotel! Staff is great and attentive, close to theater, restaurants, and a nice walk up town or down town. We highly recommend this hotel for your NYC stay!",R
"Was in NYC for a couple of nights and another hotel was booked for me. It was a disappointing place and after one night I decided to move to The Bryant Park Hotel, where I had stayed two times before. To make a long story short: it was once more fantastic! You simply can‚Äôt go wrong with this place - it‚Äôs truly the best choice in the city. Room and bathroom: clean, comfortable and spacious! (for a fair price) Location: mid town, at Bryant Park, which is nearby everything. Staff: always kind and helpful (thank you Dennis, Aishley and Miguel at the front desk). Design and atmosphere of the hotel: modern and cool! And as an extra asset there is the very cool club in the basement. This hotel is by far my top favorite on Manhattan. Highly recommended!",R
"My wife and I routinely do theater weekends in NYC and years ago found the Bryant Park Hotel as our home in the city. We've had countless stays and each visit it better than the last. When walking in Saturday morning, John greeted us by name with a huge smile and handshake. You can tell he truly cares about guests. Every staff member was, as always, upbeat and friendly. Our room was immaculate as always, minimalist but still elegant. Seeing Miguel, who has gone out of his way to make us feel at home every time, Sunday evening as we were leaving was the icing on the cake. The addition of coffee and water in the elevator lobby is a nice touch! Can't wait to return back home in a few months.",R
"Visited NYC for work- great location, modern rooms with all the amazing amenities, and staff who actually appreciate your business to ensure to have an awesome stay... and return! From doorman to front desk staff- it was a pleasure! NYC hospitality!",R
"Wow! This was the absolute perfect hotel for everything we wanted to do in NYC. We had two beautiful suites overlooking the park. The suites were spacious, comfortable, and beautiful! The location was fantastic, and we walked to three fabulous dinners. Our daughter ran her first marathon, and she did REALLY well. We think that her great night of sleep made all the difference. The team was amazing - friendly, professional, and helpful! We look forward to our next visit. We are ‚Äútravel snobs‚Äù, and we recommend this hotel to the most discerning of travelers! :)",R
"Great hotel, great location & great staff! Very clean with comfortable bed and amazing shower. Got upgraded to a junior suite overlooking Bryant Park. Didn‚Äôt try hotel bar or restaurant but plenty of choices nearby. Will definitely stay here again.",R
"My daughter and I booked a junior suite (room 909) which was very spacious with a large living room, a dining room table and a king size bed. The views of Bryant Park and the city were quite nice. The refrigerator was actually cold, a rare treat. We appreciated the Molton Brown toiletries, bathrobes and the soft thick towels. The only complaint was the outlets wouldn't keep a charger plugged in, kept falling out. The front desk staff and the doormen were very cordial and aimed to please. Would have liked a Keurig in the room instead of going downstairs for morning coffee.",R
I am thankful for Miguel and Job at the desk. They treated my family and I with outstanding hospitality and service. My wife became ill and we were put up in a beautiful room! I mean this place is spotless and modern. The guys got me in through Hotel Tonight in literally 5 minutes. It makes me want to visit again soon. I love New York!,R
"We arrived the Bryant Park Hotel just prior to the Labour Day Public Holiday The staff are very friendly & accommodating Our initial room a step up from standard however like many New York rooms was very small not even enough room for our cases The breakfast area fortunately had both inside seating & alfresco, this was needed as seating & food was at a premium because the hotel was fully booked Also due to the hotel being full the flow on affect was the lifts were very slow We had to travel to Chicago for 2 days & the hotel allowed us to store our bags in their holding area which was good Upon our return the Labour Day Holiday was over we upgraded our new room to a suite- fantastic could actually get to our cases without climbing over things With less guests the breakfast",R
"My husband and I have just returned from our second stay at the Bryant Park Hotel having stayed for 10 nights last year. We were not disappointed all the staff from check in at reception ,concierge, security staff and housekeepers they were all extremely friendly efficient and professional. The room was spotlessly clean and the turn down service excellent along with the Moulton Brown toiletries. We were always greeted with a friendly smile from all the security staff when we left and returned to the hotel. The Koi restaurant was as good as last year and a must for any visitor. The view of the park was amazing and this is certainly the only hotel we will stay in when visiting New York. Thank you Bryant Park for another super holiday.",R
"First time in New York, and I have to say that the staff at the Bryant Park Hotel are hands down the best in the business. I was checked in by John upon arrival. Having driven quite a distance my 7 year old had to use the facilities and even though we were extremely early for check in, John accommodated my son and I without hesitation he had us booked in a room and ready to go within minutes even though we were almost three and a half hours early. The room was very large, very clean and we had a beautiful view of Bryant Park. I was very nervous about driving and parking in the city so we opted for valet parking, which again was very seamless and so very convenient. I don't of course know all the staff members names, but every single one of the was courteous, kind and so",R
"Stayed for my birthday weekend, and had the best time! Ashley and Emily were both so helpful with anything I needed. Everything was beautiful and the service was impeccable! Beautiful room and view! I will definitely be back!!",R
"A lifelong NY-er (who recently left), I'm hard to impress. But this has become my go-to home-away-from-home when I visit the city. The bed, the bathroom, the proximity to the park, the sushi...I could go on and on and on. The front desk team -- Miguel and Dennis -- are truly amazing. I can't imagine staying anywhere else. If I could give it six stars, I would!",R
"My wife and I recently got to stay at the Bryant Park Hotel. It had been a couple of years since we were in New York and we were glad that the Hotel continues to provide top notch customer service, looks great, has added amenities, and is so central to everything. As we were getting out of our Lyft, Matthew greeted us and welcomed us back to the Hotel. He took us into Yasmin at the front desk, who cheerfully introduced herself, welcomed us back, gave us bottles of water and told us about the changes at the Hotel since our last stay two years ago, which included a new morning coffee and muffin service and a complete overhaul of their bar venue. The customer service is top notch and we always feel like the most important guest in the Hotel when we stay there. Yasmin",R
All I have to say is WOW! Booked a room for my parents 30th year anniversary and Miguel and Job upgraded our room free of charge! I have never received better service! Highly recommended staying here!,R
"We loved this hotel! We were able to check in early, and efficiently. Very friendly and helpful staff. We received bottles of water upon check in. Room was large, bathroom was large. Lovely decor! We will definitely stay here again!",R
"It was a very nice stay in the center of Manhattan,near ther Bryant Park,a vibrant place with a lot of events during the evenings,with nice terraces,good air and nice people to meet.The hotel itself is expensive but the location is one of the best for New York.You have between 6 to 8 am a complimentary coffee and muffin only breakfast,water in the lobby,very clean rooms and very good services.I,ll be back",R
"My wife and I travelled to NY for just a few days to see a play and explore Manhattan. We chose the hotel because it was near the Hudson theater and directly across from Bryant park. We were thrilled to be in such a wonderful location and it didn't disappoint in any way. The view of the park was wonderful from our room and my wife really appreciated the sitting bench by the window. The staff was great, the restaurant was delicious, the rooms were modern and spacious. It was a great time and I'll definitely stay here again next time I come out this way.",R
"The Bryant Park Hotel is a great place to stay when you are in NYC. The location is ideal as Bryant Park has so many wonderful things going on as well as just a nice place to grab a snack and hang out. The hotel is so welcoming from the doormen to the check in staff to the housekeeping. They are very accommodating and helpful. We have been to NYC many times and have stayed in many hotels and the Bryant Park Hotel is by far our favorite. The rooms are relatively spacious and very clean. The bathrooms are a nice size and asking for extra towels was never a problem. I‚Äôd like to mention names specifically, but I can‚Äôt remember a specific name. It doesn‚Äôt matter though because there wasn‚Äôt one person who worked there that wasn‚Äôt kind and nice. Stay there next time you need a place",R
"We stayed here for five nights and found the location to be very convienent if you are going to be going uptown and downtown. I don't usually like to stay so close to Times Square but we had events uptown, a broadway show, and love going to the east and west villages. There is a subway station at the end of the block and Bryant Park is across the street. We had a one bedroom suite and it was super spacious, especially for NY!!! Javier, along with the rest of the staff were all helpful, friendly, and professional. Would definitely stay here again.",R
"From valet to checkout and all in between it was 5Star as expected for an amazing price. Thanks to the staff for always making us feel welcomed, even during The Manhattan Blackout 2019. (thanks for having power)",R
"I stayed at Bryant Park Hotel only for one night during a business trip. It is a very nice hotel, the room was big, clean and comfortable. Great service and staff, and beautiful view on the Park. Hope I will stay again for more nights.",R
"This was my 3rd stay at the hotel and as always it was great. The location is fantastic you walk out of the hotel right into Bryant Park, Times Square is right around the corner. And there is almost always something to do right in Bryant Park. The staff is great and always helpful with sight seeing and cool things to do. And the restaurant attached ""koi"" is top notch. Unless something changes I will always stay at the Bryant Park Hotel when visiting the city.",R
"This is a European-style hotel -- everything you need but no frills, at least in the queen bed room I had. The bathroom was huge, a nice change for NYC. What really stood out for me was the helpfulness and friendliness of the staff. I checked in fairly late in the evening to a friendly greeting, the restaurant staff were prompt and warm, and the bellperson who took my bag for storage during my meeting asked without my mentioning it whether I would need a taxi for the airport later in the day (I did, and it was there right on time). Great for business travel (the onsite restaurant wouldn't be my first choice with kiddos, but there are of course tons of other options just steps away). Will stay again!",R
"Would 100% recommend this hotel. From the moment we arrived and were greeted by Job on reception who helped us with our check in and informed us of our complimentary upgrade, to the moment we checked out and were helped by Jonathan who called us a taxi, waited with us and helped us with our bags into the taxi, we were made to feel very welcome by every member of staff we met. As soon as we walked through the front doors we were greeted every time and a lift called for us (which came pretty instantly) we stayed on the 12th Floor and had amazing views of the park, library and 6th Avenue. Yes the hotel is a little on the pricy side but the location and the service is worth it. Situated on 40th Street we were a 5 minute walk away from Times Square, there was a subway entrance just",R
"I have been staying at the Bryant Hotel for the last 10 years. Service is always impeccable. The staff are friendly, professional and go out of their way to help. The hotel is in a fabulous location, opposite Bryant Park. It's a great place to sit and relax before and after work",R
"My wife and I stayed here for our 5 year anniversary. The staff were polite and friendly. While we stayed there, we never had to wait to get help at the front desk. We got a balcony room on the 19th floor and it was WONDERFUL. It's by far the largest room I've stayed in in New York and the balcony view of Bryant Park was spectacular. Even ignoring the balcony, we had a lot of windows and plenty of space. As easily seen on a map, the location is great too. It's right across the road from the very pretty and fun Bryant Park.",R
Staying here after my hotel messed up my reservation. Wonderful stay. Everyone you come across is very service focused. Room was fantastic- large for NYC. Absolutely and without question the very best bathroom I‚Äôve ever had; water pressure remarkable for NYC..... will most certainly return! Thanks Bryant Park x,R
"A last minute booking brought us here. As soon as we pulled up outside the hotel we were met by Job from the front desk who helped with ""valeting"" the car and checking us in. Reception was full of friendly faces. Job made sure our one night experience was memorable. Our bellman Chiran, from Nepal was delightful as he took us to our room with our luggage. The location was perfect, overlooking Bryant Park and close to Times Square. All in all what makes the hotel a place to go back to (at least our second visit) and recommend it to our friends and post a five star review on TA is the staff and their passion to make you happy. We would give them all a big hug but these days that might be misconstrued !",R
"Seamless service from the moment we walked in the door. Room was bigger than expected and had a great view of Bryant Park. Spacious bedroom and bathroom, all very tastefully equipped. Great visit - wish we could have stayed longer!",R
"I came to the Bryant Park Hotel back in January to celebrate my birthday and I booked their Bryant Park Suite and it was a minimalist's dream come true! a decadent, luxurious room that had a living room two bathrooms and a very big center room. The amenities both in my room and within the hotel were wonderful. The hotel also has a restaurant KOI right alongside of it if you want to stay in with amazing, state of the art Asian cuisine. Lastly, the hotel has a great nightlife where the bar also doubles as a ambient lounge/club scene after 12. I also had the hotel's breakfast through room service on the night of my departure and it was absolutely delicious and full of a variety of options for those big on breakfast, highly recommend. My favorite part was definitely the beautiful",R
It is very nice hotel and service was also very good.,F
"Such a stupid hotel, I wont recommend it if your are getting for free also.",F
I and my wife went for our anniversry and itís a terrible experience at that night. We were forced to leave that place at midnight and we were helpless.,F
"We went for trip to newyark from india. We stayed there for 5 days and it is an excellent place to stay. We feel very comfortable and safe over there, As this is new place to us. ",F
Good place to stay,F
"We went to bryant hotel for office meeting and its very good place. We have an amazing after party, the view from balcony you cant complain about it.",F
"We were very pleasantly accommodated. Location, service, valet, restaurant, rooms and most importantly, the staff, were all 5 star. Will definitely come back",F
The room was very clean and spacious. Easy to organize your stuff for a longer stay. Excellent location  Very handicap accessible. No room service or room cleaning. They were pretty busy. Hotel restaurant was more fancy so expensive not really kid friendly food. The bonus was it is open until midnight if you are desperate for real food. The snack shop and laundry facilities were convenient. The terrace on the 3rd floor is cute and peaceful. The pool is 4 ft deep everywhere and on the smaller side so not little kid friendly. Overall it was a nice hotel and I would stay here again.,F
"Super location, great staff and very nice facility",F
"What a wonderful stay! I had to make a last minute booking and my stay was affordable, and extremely comfortable! The staff was lovely, very helpful and friendly. The room was clean and spacious, and the bed was very comfortable. Best night sleep I've had in a while! I will definitely be visiting again!",F
"New hotel, very nice. Walk to restaurants. Enjoyed our stay. Would stay here again.",F
